# Advance-Solidity

Assignment found to be more difficult than I thought. Metamask was not lining up exactly how I wanted however I was able to make a couple of successful transactions.

Remix coupled with MetaMask and Ganache can be taxing at times, however with a green check marked deployment, adjustments can be made to select transferable accounts and conduct mock transactions between the minter and  recipient.
